The project integrates various data-handling techniques — from collection and wrangling to analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation — with an emphasis on generating actionable insights for stakeholders.

🎯 Project Objectives
Identify and compare popular technologies across job postings and developer surveys

Extract data using web scraping and APIs

Perform data wrangling and preprocessing

Apply exploratory and statistical analysis techniques

Visualize patterns and distributions using plots and dashboards

Build interactive dashboards in IBM Cognos Analytics

Deliver insights in a presentation format suitable for executives

🧰 Project Workflow
📥 Data Collection
I began by extracting job listing data for technologies such as Java, Python, MySQL, C++, and C# using the GitHub Jobs API. To supplement the data, I used web scraping methods to gather additional salary and skill information from public webpages. After retrieval, I examined the datasets to assess structure, data types, and completeness.


🧹 Data Preparation
Data wrangling techniques were applied to clean and standardize the datasets. This involved:

Identifying and removing duplicates

Handling missing values

Standardizing formats

Analyzing categorical variables (e.g., employment type)


📊 Data Exploration
I performed exploratory data analysis to understand the underlying trends and relationships within the datasets. Key steps included:

Generating histograms and KDE plots to understand distributions

Identifying outliers and computing statistical bounds (IQR, median)

Analyzing correlations between numerical variables

Creating new variables for deeper insight



📈 Visual Analytics
Using data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019, I created meaningful visualizations to showcase:

Technology usage by developers

Preferences for programming languages, databases, and platforms

Demographic patterns by gender, age, and education

Visualizations included:

Histograms, scatter plots, and bubble charts

Box plots and pie charts

Bar and stacked bar charts



📊 Dashboard Development
I developed an interactive dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics, featuring three main areas:

Current Technology Landscape – Languages, databases, frameworks, and platforms in current use

Emerging Trends – Tools and technologies developers plan to adopt

Demographic Analysis – User distribution by region, gender, age, and education

Each tab included filterable and interactive charts designed for decision-makers.

📽️ Final Presentation
I concluded the project by creating a presentation summarizing the analysis journey, key insights, and recommendations. This included visuals and talking points designed for a non-technical audience.
